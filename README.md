# Penalty-Method-Obliquely-Reflected-Diffusions

This project implements an approximation of solutions of stochastic differential equations
driven by Brownian motion which are moving inside a domain and obliquely reflected at the boundary. This approximation is achieved by replacing the reflection term with a penalty function.  The motivation of this project is based on the article published by  and Amponsah, C. and  Sarantsev, A., (2018).  The article can be found here: https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01777v9
