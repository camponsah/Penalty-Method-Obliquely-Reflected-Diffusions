# Penalty-Method-Obliquely-Reflected-Diffusions
This project seeks to implement an approximation of solutions of stochastic differential equations
driven by Brownian motion which are moving inside a domain and obliquely reflected at the boundary. This approximation is achieved by replacing the reflection term with a penalty function.  The motivation of this project is based on the article published by Sarantsev, A. (2017) v8, Cameron Bruggeman, C. and  Sarantsev, A. (2016) v5  and Sarantsev, A. and Amponsah, C. (2018).
